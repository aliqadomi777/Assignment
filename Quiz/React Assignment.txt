Assignment Requirements
1.Create Components
Build and use the following components:

<App />: Root component

<StudentList />: Receives array of student objects via props

<StudentCard />: Displays single student details and a conditional badge

<AlertButton />: Button that, when clicked, alerts a message

2. Display Array of Student Objects
In your App.jsx, define this array:

const students = [
  { id: 1, name: "Sarah Ali", grade: 95 },
  { id: 2, name: "Omar Tarek", grade: 82 },
  { id: 3, name: "Lina Haddad", grade: 76 }
];

Pass this array to <StudentList students={students} />.

3. Render List Using .map()
In the <StudentList /> component:
Use .map() to generate a list of <StudentCard /> components.
Pass name and grade as props to each card.

4. Conditional Rendering
In the <StudentCard /> component:
Display the student name and grade.
If grade >= 85, show this badge: "Excellent Student"
Otherwise, show this badge: "Needs Improvement"
Use a ternary operator inside JSX for this logic.

5. Click Event
In each <StudentCard />, include an <AlertButton /> component with this feature:
When clicked, it should alert a message like:
Student: Sarah Ali â€” Grade: 95
You must pass the alert message from the parent component to <AlertButton /> using props.

Bonus
Add a footer <Footer /> component that simply displays the total number of students.
Use students.length and pass it as a prop.
